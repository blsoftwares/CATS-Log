					<p>This is some dummy copy. You’re not really supposed to read this dummy copy, it is just a place holder for people who need some type to visualize what the actual copy might look like if it were real content.</p>
<p>If you want to read, I might suggest a good book, perhaps <a title="Hemingway" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway">Hemingway</a> or <a title="Melville" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville">Melville</a>. That’s why they call it, the dummy copy. This, of course, is not the real copy for this entry. Rest assured, the words will expand the concept. With clarity. Conviction. And a little wit.</p>
<p>In today’s competitive <a title="market environment" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_environment">market environment</a>, the body copy of your entry must lead the reader through a series of <strong>disarmingly simple thoughts</strong>.</p>
<h3>Long copy or short – You decide</h3>
<p>As a marketer, you probably don’t even believe in body copy. <strong>Let alone long body copy</strong>. (Unless you have a long body yourself.) Well, truth is, who‘s to blame you? Fact is, too much long body copy is dotted with such indulgent little phrases like <a title="truth" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth">truth</a> is, fact is, and who’s to blame you. Trust us: we guarantee, with a hand over our heart, that no such indulgent rubbish will appear in your entry. That’s why God gave us big blue pencils. So we can expunge every example of witted waffle.</p>
<blockquote><p>For you, the skies will be blue, the birds will sing, and your copy will be crafted by a dedicated little man whose wife will be sitting at home, knitting, wondering why your entry demands more of her husband‘s time than it should.</p></blockquote>
